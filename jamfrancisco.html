                    <p>While working for The Orchard (Sony Music Entertainment) I was responsible for promoting artists, movies, and more from independent record labels. The first task that I was placed with was creating an organic lifestyle brand to attract the San Francisco music market. “Jam Francisco” became the name of the music blog that I used to generate interest in touring artists and promote new releases.
                        <br><br>
                    This brand spanned across 5 different social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Soundcloud, Twitter, and Tumblr. I was responsible for creating content and maintaining active engagement on these platforms throughout my time at The Orchard (20-40 times per campaign).</p>

                <h1>Marketing Campaigns</h1>
                <p>Each campaign started with a team game plan for the assignment. Each artist had its unique market and necessitated its own attention.
    
                For more mature audiences, I would target coffee shops, higher-end clothing retails, and promote the bands on older demographic social medias like Facebook and Twitter.
                
                For younger audiences, I would target hot spots around SFSU, trendy accounts like thrift shops, dive bars, and post on youth-heavy social medias like Instagram and Tumblr.</p>
